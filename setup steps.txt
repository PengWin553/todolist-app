Here's a clear, step-by-step guide to setting up and running Golang in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install Go
   - Go to https://go.dev/dl/
   - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows)
   - Run the installer
   - IMPORTANT: Check the option to "Add Go to PATH" during installation

2. Prepare Visual Studio Code
   - Open Visual Studio Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Go" 
   - Install the official "Go" extension by Go Team at Google

3. Reload VS Code
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + P
   - Type 'reload'
   - Select 'Developer: Reload Window'

4. Install Go Tools
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Run these commands:
     ```
     go install -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
     go install -v github.com/ramya-rao-a/go-outline@latest
     ```

5. Create Your First Go Project
   - Open VS Code
   - File > Open Folder (select or create a new project folder)
   - Create a new file named `hello-world.go`

6. Write Your First Go Program
   - In `hello-world.go`, type:
     ```go
     package main

     import "fmt"

     func main() {
         fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
     }
     ```

7. Run the Program
   - Option 1: Using VS Code Run Button
     - Look for the "Run" triangle (play button) at the top right of the editor
     - Click it to run the program
   - Option 2: Using Terminal
     - Open Terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
     - Type: `go run hello-world.go`

8. Troubleshooting
   - If you encounter any issues:
     - Ensure Go is in your system PATH
     - Restart VS Code
     - Check that Go tools are installed correctly
     - Look for any error messages in the VS Code output or terminal

Additional Tips:
- VS Code may prompt you to install additional Go tools when you open a Go file
- Accept these prompts to set up a complete development environment
- The Go extension provides features like:
  - Intellisense
  - Code navigation
  - Debugging support
